	on click:yield 1 iron
Buildings
// Basic Buildings
*solarPanel
	name:Solar Panel
	desc:A small solar panel, ready to make power orbiting a star. Makes 1 watt of power per second.
	on tick:yield 1 power
	cost:3 iron
*miningBot
	name:Mining Bot
	desc:A drone, which can mine for you. Takes 2 watts of power a second to run, though!
	cost:6 iron
	on tick:if (power >= 2) yield 1 iron
	on tick:lose 2 power
	req:(4power)
*panelLine
	name:Solar Panel Assembler
	desc:An assembly line for solar panels. Costs 5 watts of power a second, alongside the building cost of a solar panel.
	cost:15 iron
	on tick:if (power >= 5 and iron >= 3) yield 1 solarPanel
	on tick:lose 5 power
	on tick:lose 3 iron
	req:(4power)
//Research
*researcher
	name:Researcher
	desc:Power goes in, research comes out. How? Dunno, probably the turbo-encabulator. Costs 100 watts a second.
	on tick:if (power >= 100) yield 1 research
	on tick:lose 100 power
	req:(1mPanels)
//Sphere Forming
*panelClumper
	name:Panel Clumper
	desc:A handy little drone, that can fuse together solar panels. Aint that nice? Costs 200 watts a second.
	on tick:if (power >= 200 and solarPanel >= 250) yield 1 panelClump
	on tick:lose 200 power
	on tick:lose 250 solarPanel
	req:(panelClumping)
*panelClump
	name:Panel Clump
	desc:An efficient little clump of solar panels. These cannot be bought.
	on tick:yield 500 power
	no buy
	req:(panelClumping)
Upgrades
*panelClumping
	name:Panel Clumping
	desc:You have a lot of solar panels, don't you? Well, this will unlock panel clumpers, a type of drone which can do just that! And, it makes them twice ass efficient in the process!
	req:100 research
	cost:250 research
